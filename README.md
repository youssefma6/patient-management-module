Patient Management Module
Overview
The Patient Management Module is a web application designed to manage patient records in a healthcare system. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on patient data, adhering to the mockup design provided in images/maquette.png. The application is built using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Smarty Template Engine, and AdminLTE template for a responsive and user-friendly interface.

Search: Filter patients by name (available only on the patient listing page).
Pagination: Navigate through patient records with page controls (available only on the patient listing page).


Add Patient: Admit new patients with details like name, mobile, date, doctor, department, and an optional photo.
Edit Patient: Update existing patient records.
Delete Patient: Remove patient records with confirmation.
Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Technologies Used

PHP 7.4: Backend logic and API handling.
MySQL: Database for storing patient records.

$dsn = 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=patient_management';
$username = 'root';
$password = '';




Set Up File Permissions:

Ensure the uploads/ directory is writable for storing patient photos:
On Windows, right-click uploads/, go to Properties > Security, and grant write permissions.

On Linux, run:
chmod -R 777 uploads/
